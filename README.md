This repository contains the code for the paper "Parameterizing pressure-temperature profiles
of exoplanet atmospheres with neural networks" (accepted for publication in A&A).

_Note (2023-09-05): We have recently updated the code to be compatible with the latest versions of the PyTorch and Lightning._
_Consequently, the results obtained with the new code may differ marginally from the ones reported in the paper._

## ‚ö° Getting started

### üì¶ Installation

The code in this repository is organized as a Python package named `ml4ptp`.
To get started, clone this repository and install `ml4ptp` using pip (or your favorite package manager):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:timothygebhard/ml4ptp.git
cd ml4ptp
pip install .
```

The code was written with Python 3.8 in mind, but we expect it to work also with newer versions of Python.


### üèï Setting up the environment

The code assumes that the following environment variables are set:

```bash
export ML4PTP_DATASETS_DIR=/path/to/datasets ;
export ML4PTP_EXPERIMENTS_DIR=/path/to/experiments ;
```

You might want to add these lines to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.

Note that the `datasets` and `experiments` directories are part of this repository and hold scripts and default configurations.
However, using the above environment variables allows you to flexibly move the inputs and outputs of the code to different locations on your machine (e.g., you do not need to store your data together with the code).

## üê≠ Tests

This repository comes with a rather extensive set of unit tests (based on [`pytest`](https://pytest.org)). 
After installing `ml4ptp` with the `[develop]` option, the tests can be run as:

```bash
pytest tests
```

You can also use these tests to ensure that the code is compatible with newer versions of the libraries than the one in `setup.py`.
