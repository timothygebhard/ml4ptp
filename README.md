## üå° What's this?

This repository contains code to train and apply efficient, neural network-based parameterizations of pressure temperature (PT) profiles of exoplanets which can be used, for example, for atmospheric retrievals.  


## ‚ö° Getting started

The code in this repository is organized as a Python package named `ml4ptp`.
To get started, clone this repository and install `ml4ptp` using pip (or your favorite package manager):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:timothygebhard/ml4ptp.git
cd ml4ptp
pip install .
```

## üê≠ Tests

This repository comes with an extensive set of unit and integration tests (based on [`pytest`](https://pytest.org)). 
After installing `ml4ptp` with the `[develop]` option, the tests can be run as:

```bash
pytest tests
```

You can also use these tests to ensure that the code is compatible with newer versions of the libraries than the one in `setup.py`.
