## üå° What's this?

This repository contains code to train and apply efficient, neural network-based parameterizations of pressure temperature (PT) profiles of exoplanets which can be used, for example, for atmospheric retrievals.  


## ‚ö° Getting started

### üì¶ Installation

The code in this repository is organized as a Python package named `ml4ptp`.
To get started, clone this repository and install `ml4ptp` using pip (or your favorite package manager):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:timothygebhard/ml4ptp.git
cd ml4ptp
pip install .
```

### üèï Setting up the environment

The code assumes that the following environment variables are set:

```bash
export ML4PTP_DATASETS_DIR=/path/to/datasets ;
export ML4PTP_EXPERIMENTS_DIR=/path/to/experiments ;
```

You might want to add these lines to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.

Note that the `datasets` and `experiments` directories are part of this repository and hold scripts and default configurations.
However, using the above environment variables allows you to flexibly move the inputs and outputs of the code to different locations on your machine (e.g., you do not need to store your data together with the code).

### üê≠ Tests

This repository comes with an extensive set of unit and integration tests (based on [`pytest`](https://pytest.org)). 
After installing `ml4ptp` with the `[develop]` option, the tests can be run as:

```bash
pytest tests
```

You can also use these tests to ensure that the code is compatible with newer versions of the libraries than the one in `setup.py`.
