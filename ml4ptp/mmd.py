    Compute the MMD metric (assuming a Gaussian kernel) between two
    samples `x` and `y`, as given by eq. (3) in Gretton et al. (2012):

    Note: Technically, this functions returns the *squared* MMD, which
    may still be negative (because it is an unbiased estimator).

    Args:
        x: A tensor of shape (n, d) containing the first sample.
        y: A tensor of shape (m, d) containing the second sample.
        sigma: The bandwidth of the Gaussian kernel. If `None`, the
            median heuristic is used to estimate `sigma` automatically.

    Returns:
        The unbiased squared MMD between `x` and `y`.
